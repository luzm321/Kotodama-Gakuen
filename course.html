        At the end of their second year at Kotodama, students are required to choose a minimum of two more subjects from the following list: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures.
        Very specialized subjects such as Alchemy are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand.</p>

                <h3 class="col-title">Intermediate</h3>
                <p class="rowParagraph">During intermediate year, students have an appointment with their head of house to discuss which job they would like to go into, the teacher will recommend any specific subjects for N.E.W.T. level required for this job, taking into account predicted O.W.L. grades based on current performance. 
                <br>The teacher may recommend subjects based on the student's current grades if the student is unsure of what job they would like.</p>

                <h3 class="col-title">Degree</h3>
                <p class="rowParagraph"> To obtain a Wizard Auror degree, you need to fulfill Auror training. If accepted into Auror training, prospective Aurors are required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests. 
                <br>These tests are conducted to evaluate how students react under pressure. Applicants are then required to train extensively in advanced magical combat and other elements of practical defence, and most likely methods of criminal investigation.</p>

                <h3 class="col-title">Post-Graduation</h3>
                <p class="rowParagraph">An Auror's profession after graduation is to investigate crimes related to the Dark Arts and to hunt down and capture Dark Wizards. In times of conflict, they operate in some ways as soldiers, though also as intelligence agents, seeking out Dark wizards and defeating them, often in fierce wizard duels.
                <br>The Ministry also enlisted Aurors to guard high profile targets.</p>
